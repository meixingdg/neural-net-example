Example autoencoder implementation basedon the neural network in Chapter 1 of http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html.

The MNIST dataset is used and the reconstruction error is set as the average mean squared error. 

This was mainly an understanding exercise, so I commented copiously. Hopefully the comments will be helpful to others.
